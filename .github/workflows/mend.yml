          # ******** Description ********
          # mend dep will automatically use package managers and file system scanning to detect open source components.
          # mend code will automatically detect languages and frameworks used in your projects to scan for code weaknesses.
          # mend image will scan the local image:tag for open source components and secrets.
          
          # If you are NOT using a service user, and have multiple organizations, don't forget to scall the scope -s parameter to set the organization
